## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
businessdata <- read.csv("/Users/moshihathiyaageswaran/Downloads/Yelp Dataset Business.csv")
```

```{r}
head(businessdata)
```

```{r}
str(businessdata)
```

```{r}
summary(businessdata)
```

```{r}
#Filter state for BC
businessdata <- businessdata[c("business_id", "city", "state", "stars", "review_count", "is_open", "categories")]
businessdataa <- businessdata[businessdata$state == "BC",]
businessdataa
```

```{r}
#Filter business for open
businessData <- businessdataa[businessdataa$is_open == "1", ]
businessData
```

```{r}
#Filter data for restaurants
library(dplyr)
businessData %>%
  select(business_id, city, state, stars, review_count, is_open, categories) %>% 
  filter(grepl('Restaurants', categories))
```

```{r}
reviewdata <- read.csv("/Users/moshihathiyaageswaran/Downloads/Yelp Dataset Review.csv")
```

```{r}
summary(reviewdata)
```

```{r}
#Filter data for recent reviews (2018)
library(dplyr)
reviewdata <- reviewdata[c("review_id", "business_id", "stars", "date", "text")]
reviewdata %>% filter(grepl('2018',date))
```
```{r}
library(dplyr)
yelpdataset <- merge(businessData, reviewdata)
yelpdataset
```
